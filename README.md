Custom color variants
=====================

You can generate your own Mint-Y icon colors theme easily.

Say you want to generate a "Suse" theme with these colors:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1138515/236241924-0552bebc-0d5c-4167-b8dd-444c76a8554e.png)

1. Go to `src/places`
2. In `generate-color-variations.py`, each `VARIANTS.append({...})` line defines a color variant.
3. Add an extra line with the proper name and color codes and save the file. For instance, to make the Suse theme you would add this line:

```
VARIANTS.append({"name":"Suse","folder":"183f50","backfolder":"00a489","paper":"e4e4e4","emblem":"e4e4e4"})
```

4. Run `./generate-color-variations.py`. This generates `Suse.svg`.
3. Run `./render_places.py Suse`. This generates the new icon theme in `../../usr/share/icons/Mint-Y-Suse`.
4. You can test your theme by copying it to `/usr/share/icons/` or `~/.icons/`
6. This theme only contains places icons, but it inherits Mint-Y, so you can package it or distribute it to anyone who already has Mint-Y installed.

Useful commands
===============

To find circular symbolic links:

	find . -follow -printf ""

To find broken links use `./deadlinks` or:

	find -L usr/ -type l

To find files with spaces in their filenames (that breaks the icon cache generation):

	find . | egrep '. '
